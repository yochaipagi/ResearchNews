# Coding workflow preferences

    - my job depend on this prject.
    - you have to be the best cooder in order to help me with this project
    - Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
    - Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
    - Write thorough tests for all major functionality
    - Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
    - Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
